Predicting the probability that each person has a diagnosis of Type II Diabetes

Type II diabetes is associated with a range of complications that can significantly impact the quality of life for individuals affected. Early identification of individuals at risk of developing Type II Diabetes allows for targeted and timely preventive interventions, which can reduce the burden of the disease for patients while offering significant value to the healthcare system as a whole. As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise globally, identifying high-risk individuals becomes increasingly crucial for the long-term sustainability of healthcare systems.

The workflow of this code analysis is:

1. Download the 'datasetPracticeFusionDiabetes.zip' Zip file, which consist of 17 different files, 2 common files and 15 data set-specific files in csv format.
2. Load the files into the working file directory.
3. Refer to the 'PracticeFusionDataSetDictionary.pdf' file for a dataset dictionary, a description of the table elements, and a chart showing how the tables are connected.
4. Run the file 'diabetes_prediction.ipynb' in a Python IDE, which selects relevant data from the various files, merges them into a single dataframe, and create the machine learning models to form predictions.
